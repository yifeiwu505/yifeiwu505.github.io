	     <pre>I love arts. Any kinds. 
            I am fasinated by the idea that media can affect so many people. Can somehow manipulate people as well. This is the reason why I am taking media courses. 
                For this course specifically, I wanna develope general skills for <i>photo editing, photo making, photoshop, web design</i>, etc. </pre>
