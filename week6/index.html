		Men themselves have wondered   
		What they see in me.
		They try so much
		But they can’t touch
		My inner mystery.
		When I try to show them,   
		They say they still can’t see.   
		I say,
		It’s in the arch of my back,   
		The sun of my smile,
		The ride of my breasts,
		The grace of my style.
		I’m a woman
		Phenomenally.
		Phenomenal woman,
		That’s me.

		Now you understand
		Just why my head’s not bowed.   
		I don’t shout or jump about
		Or have to talk real loud.   
		When you see me passing,
		It ought to make you proud.
		I say,
		It’s in the click of my heels,   
		The bend of my hair,   
		the palm of my hand,   
		The need for my care.   
		’Cause I’m a woman
		Phenomenally.
		Phenomenal woman,
		That’s me.
